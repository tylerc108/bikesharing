## Analysis Overview
For this week's analysis, we assisted a bike sharing startup to conduct analysis on a business proposal to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a good idea. To do this, we conducted analysis on an existing bike-sharing program in New York City to prove that this type of program can be successful. 

## Results
For our analysis, we conducted a series of tests on the data we had on Citi Bike, the bike-sharing app in New York. Below you can see seven examples of our analysis:

The image above is a graph we created that shows length of time that bikes have been checked out for all users.

The above image shows a graph we created that displays the length of time bikes have been checked out based on gender. More bikes were taken out by males and for a slightly longer period of time on average than females.

This graph above shows the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day as a heatmap. Peak ride times were during standard commuting/rush hour times and peak days were weekdays.


<img width="1024" alt="Screen Shot 2022-07-27 at 9 53 15 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103055666/181264532-b2e7e000-4d31-4292-aa94-f22243b9a9ce.png">

This graph shows the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week as a heatmap, similar to the last one but now including gender as a variable. The two gender heatmaps looks very similar other than the total volume of rides, as we know males tend to take out bikes more than females.


<img width="999" alt="Screen Shot 2022-07-27 at 9 55 25 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103055666/181265043-014b5229-84f1-43a5-ba95-bb837c857174.png">

This graph shows the number of bike trips broken down by gender for each day of the week by each "usertype". It shows very clearly that subscribers take out bikes much more often than regular customers.


<img width="967" alt="Screen Shot 2022-07-27 at 10 00 42 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103055666/181266341-dc848bf3-f337-461a-b063-598712591021.png">

This graph shows percentage of bikes taken out broken down by gender in a pie chart. As is clear from looking at the pie chart, men make up a much greater percentage of customers than women. There is also a small third category for customers where their gender is unkown.

<img width="1018" alt="Screen Shot 2022-07-27 at 10 02 14 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103055666/181266730-2062761c-a889-43f0-ac0f-c3cc1da0d0f8.png">

This last chart is a map of bikes by bikeid showing which bikes have been taken out the most and least frequently. This is useful because we can see which bikes are most likely in need of repairs if they have been taken out a very high number of times, so we can plan accordingly which bikes we need to repair.

## Summary
Based on our analysis, we defintely believe that a bike sharing service would work well in a place like Des Moines. The reason for this is because we can see that people take these bikes out mainly to commute to work, as the peak times for taking bikes out are commuting times. In a city like Des Moines, there are many people who commute fairly short distances to their workplace, so bikes would be a great idea for them to use if they dont want to buy a car or use the limited public transit there. For further analysis, we recommend that we create more visualizations displaying relationship between checkout times by usertype as well as a visualization showing relationship between gender and usertype by time instead of by days of the week.
